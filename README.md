Rubicon (SDL Version)

A term project for intro C++ class.

Last modified March 2016.

Rubicon is a simple sidescrolling SHMUP game. This was my first attempt at developing a game. I programmed in C++ with SDL2.

Note: I made a new repo and pushed all of the files at once because the project was previously part of a BitBucket repo, of which I hadn't kept up to date in a long time anyways.

Instructions:
Just run "rubicon.exe".
If you modify then rebuild the Code::Blocks project, it will make a binary in "bin\Release\Project.exe".
You need to relocate that binary to the base directory for it to find the dlls and assets.
I don't feel like reconfiguring the project to make this better...
